# Website Modification Guide

This document provides guidance on how to modify and extend the personal resume website.

## File Organization

The website currently uses a single HTML file ([copy_index.html](mdc:copy_index.html)) that contains all markup, styles, and scripts. When making changes:

1. For small updates: Modify the relevant section in the HTML file
2. For larger restructuring: Consider extracting styles and scripts to separate files

## Adding Content

### New Project or Experience

To add a new project or experience:

1. Find the appropriate section (`#projects` or `#experience`)
2. Copy an existing card/timeline item structure
3. Update the content, images, and links
4. For project images, add them to the appropriate folder in `public/`

### New Section

To add a completely new section:

1. Create a new `<section>` element with a unique ID
2. Follow the existing pattern for section structure (heading, content, cards)
3. Add a link in the navigation bar if needed
4. Add any necessary styles to the `<style>` tag
5. For interactive elements, add required JavaScript to the end of the file

## Styling Changes

### Changing the Theme

The site uses a dark theme with blue accents. To modify the color scheme:

1. Update the Tailwind configuration in the `<script>` tag at the top of the file
2. Update the custom color variables in the `<style>` tag
3. Update specific component colors as needed

### Responsive Adjustments

To modify responsive behavior:

1. Check existing media queries in the `<style>` tag (mainly `@media (max-width: 768px)`)
2. Update or add media queries as needed
3. Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes for inline responsive styling

## Adding Features

### New Interactive Component

To add a new interactive component:

1. Add the HTML structure in the appropriate section
2. Add the required CSS to the `<style>` tag
3. Add the JavaScript functionality in a new `<script>` tag or in the existing script at the bottom
4. Initialize the component in the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener

### Third-Party Integrations

To add new third-party libraries or services:

1. Add the script or link tag in the `<head>` section
2. Initialize and configure the service in a new script tag
3. Make sure to test compatibility with existing features

## Performance Considerations

When modifying the site, keep these performance tips in mind:

1. Optimize images before adding them (compress, proper dimensions)
2. Minimize JavaScript execution in render-blocking positions
3. Consider lazy-loading images that are not visible on initial load
4. Test responsive layouts on various screen sizes
